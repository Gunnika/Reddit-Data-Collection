Virus\\n^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:\\n\\n* Do\\n * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub\\n * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze\\n * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell\\n * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell\\n* Don't\\n * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean\\n\\n#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)\\n^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.\\n\\n^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.\\n\\n1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.\\n\\n2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.\\n\\n3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.\\n\\n4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.\\n\\n5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.\\n\\n----\\n\\n#####Share your Idle CPU/GPU Power towards find solutions for Covid-19\\n\\n* Do you have a CPU/GPU sitting at home, not doing anything?

       "              'While talking to my mother today on phone, I came to know that after watching recent news on TV they decided to stop buying vegetables and groceries items from their usual vendors.  \\n\\nAfter some time my wife told me that her parents also stopped taking milk from their old vendor(*doodhwala*). Keep in mind that both my In-Laws and my Parents were getting all of these essential items at their doorsteps since they\\'re old customers of those vendors. \\n\\nNow after this they\\'ve to go out and buy these stuff as obviously they\\'re very firm to not get any online delivery since they won\\'t be able to know who\\'ll be coming to deliver those items.\\n\\nYesterday in one of my WhatsApp group one person sent this message: \"*Today I went out to buy vegetables and fruits and luckily I\\'ve found one shop after sorting out all the items, I was about to pay to the vendor but suddenly I came to know that he belongs to a certain community, immediately after that I dropped everything came out of the shop and then I searched and bought the same things from another vendor who belongs to a different community.*\" (This person didn\\'t use the phrase *certain/different community*)\\n\\nI tried my best to convince my parents but all my arguments, NDTV, AltNews, BoomLive and PIBFactCheck Links are in vain but then I realised that when I am not able to help OR convince most of colleagues and friends who are well educated and working in big firms, MNCs then how am I able to convince my parents?\\n\\nAnd what is the point of posting, tweeting and discussing about all these kind of issues when I am not even able to convince my family, my own parents?',\n",
