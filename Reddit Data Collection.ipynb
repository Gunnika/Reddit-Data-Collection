Virus\\n^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:\\n\\n* Do\\n * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub\\n * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze\\n * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell\\n * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell\\n* Don't\\n * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean\\n\\n#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)\\n^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.\\n\\n^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.\\n\\n1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.\\n\\n2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.\\n\\n3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.\\n\\n4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.\\n\\n5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.\\n\\n----\\n\\n#####Share your Idle CPU/GPU Power towards find solutions for Covid-19\\n\\n* Do you have a CPU/GPU sitting at home, not doing anything?

      "I have been to hospitals which charge Rs. 300 for consultation and Rs. 200 for registration, which is charged even if I am never going back to that hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as far as I can remember, these registration fees were never charged before the computers came in at the receptions of these hospitals. It's practically loot money.\n",
      "Ahh Hiranandani hospital? The one with the illegal kidney transplant scam thing?\n",
      "Ofcourse they do. Have you not paid \"cooling\" charges on soft drinks ? /s\n",
      "You guys are missing the point, look at the bill, the total bill is 6500, even if the test is 4500, which it shouldn't be, those \"extra\" fees need to be regulated and include in the capped price, whata stopping anyone form add stupid surcharges,  300 for delivery,  200 for handing, 400 for hazard protection etc.\n",
      "First government said, corona test will be free and government will pay\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they said, it is free for poor only and capped price at 2000\n",
      "\n",
      "And see, what is happening in reality, people are getting looted in this critical juncture with no job, cash and food.\n",

      "Person writing \"Sauce\". A man of culture!\n",
      "Well the test itself still costs 4500. Nothing wrong with this imho.\n",
      "In that case virus will spread even more. 6,400 is a huge amount even for a middle class family. People will prefer staying at home without getting tested and this will cause more cases. Thank you Indian government for thinking about your profit even in these situations.\n",
      "almost every private hospital does this, my uncle had a stent implant done in Apollo , the cost of most expensive stent is capped @29,000 by Delhi govt and yet they charged us nearly 3.5 lacs , the wire used for stent implant was at charged 75,000 bucks, more then 2 times the cost of stent plus all kind of expenses, so yeah am not surprised.\n",
      "Have always wondered - Why do they use the word “cum” instead of “and”? Not the first time I’m seeing this\n",
      "But the test is 4500 rest are other charges. Isn't it like going to the doctor and saying why I pay you If I gonna spend money on medicines too???\n",

      "is it private?\n",
      "I don't know if I have lost touch with India in the last few years after moving abroad, but how the fuck are prices for medical procedures so freaking high in a country like India? I know it's a private hospital, but 99% of the population cannot shell out this much money for a test.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know there are government hospitals.. but this is daylight robbery. The government should do more to expand their own testing facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, 6400 INR for one medical test which isn't a full body scan will shock most people in developed countries too.\n",
      "What if someone doesnt have the money to pay for test, not even 4500. Then what happens?\n",
      "Although it's pretty retarded of the SC to ask hospitals to do it for free, arent these places supposed to actually follow the SC order?\n",
      "No wonder the testing is so low\n",
