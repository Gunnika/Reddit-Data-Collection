Virus\\n^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:\\n\\n* Do\\n * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub\\n * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze\\n * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell\\n * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell\\n* Don't\\n * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean\\n\\n#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)\\n^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.\\n\\n^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.\\n\\n1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.\\n\\n2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.\\n\\n3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.\\n\\n4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.\\n\\n5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.\\n\\n----\\n\\n#####Share your Idle CPU/GPU Power towards find solutions for Covid-19\\n\\n* Do you have a CPU/GPU sitting at home, not doing anything?

One was wife of patient from Uppinangadi discussed in [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g1zi21/coronavirus_covid19_megathread_news_and_updates_4/fno56ww?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) two days ago.  She was reported positive today. \\n\\nSecond one was heartbreaking. [A 45 year old lady from Bantwal](https://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=698591). She had been admitted yesterday night to district hospital and passed away today morning.  Her son had a travel history from Dubai on March 16th. He had completed his home quarantine. This was a total shocker as patient probably self medicated and hid the symptoms. She was also known to have asthma. I think when it was too much to tolerate she was taken to local doctor who advised them to go to the district hospital after suspecting the case. Only after death today, she was declared positive. Now her entire family and neighbours are being tested as well. Even the local Doctor is under quarantine. Entire neighborhood has been sealed down to radius of about 100m and entire town of about 5000 people is under close watch from authorities. Various members of her family may have interacted with atleast 50-100 people. Her husband is a cable operator i heard. \\n\\nThis case has caught everyone off guard. Many had thought that international travellers and their kin are safe at this point after their mandatory 14 days home quarantine. Also the local administration boasted of keeping a close watch on all international travellers after the end of their quarantine period.\\n\\nMind you, all these new cases are being reported after 12 continuous days of no cases in the district. Its too early to say but there is some pattern indicating that virus incubation period is around 24-30 days for local conditions. Previously the incubation period was thought to be around 14 days where maximum patients would develop symptoms.\\n\\nI feel all the international travellers needs to be retested several times along with their kin. All the previous assumptions are being tossed out of window each day. 7 new cases in Kerala today. 5 are from abroad (man, even after 21 days of lockdown, how the fuck!). 27 people have been discharged. 147 in hospitals. 107 new patients in Mumbai, 3 new deaths and 21 more recoveries. There is a change in testing protocol where asymptomatic people wont be tested right away, rather put in quarantine/isolation and then be tested around the 7th day, so that\\'s why the new case count is lower. But the death count has been brought under control based on the last two days.\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/ss_suryawanshi/status/1250772231896084480/photo/1 MP & Rajasthan look like they are in serious trouble. https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/coronavirus-outbreak-being-maharashtra-cm-becomes-fresh-headache-for-uddhav-1665422-2020-04-10\\n\\nJust saw this post on the Maharashtra CM\\'s post currently being subject to an election that has been deferred.

I thought only people with severe symptoms were being tested. This is exactly why we need mass scale testing instead of just testing people with symptoms. Someone known to bro died coz Gandhi hospital refused to test them for corona. Man was a 50 year old and started developing symptoms after taking his sister to a hospital for consultation. They went to Gandhi hospital and after checkup, they determined that no test was required and sent them away. A week later, symptoms become worse and he tested positive in Apollo and passed away. How can our medical system be so incompetent. The expectation is that they would begin to show symptoms after 14 days, right? 🤔 Believe it or not there is actually a silver lining to this news. This means that a lot of people have it and live through it without a lot of issues. Meaning the death rate and potency of the virus is substantially less that what is reported since number of cases are a lot more than deaths/hospitalized. Statistically speaking, you have a much higher chance of survival if you catch the virus. Whoa what a total surprise didn't expect that I have a question. What's the endgame here? There's no vaccine coming anytime soon. Would the virus die off if lockdown is extended for the month of May? Why can't scientists replicate whatever these folks had and put it in everybody??
